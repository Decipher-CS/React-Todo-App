# TODO APP

### TODO

[x] Adjust margins for top heading.
[x] Add a backend to store the todo data
[] Add a check if theme and todo exist in the localstorage because if they don't, page won't load unless refreshed. Look more into this.
[] Idea: put a switch on the header to use local storage or remote database
[] Don't wait for database on initial load. Show a skeleton instead.
