### TODO

- [x] Adjust margins for top heading.
- [x] Add a backend to store the todo data
- [ ] Add a check if theme and todo exist in the localstorage because if they don't, Page won't load unless refreshed. Look more into this.
- [ ] Idea: put a switch on the header to use local storage or remote database according to user preference.
- [ ] Don't wait for database on initial load. Show a skeleton instead on the place of all the todo items.
- [ ] Add a mui snackbar for when connection with database could not be established.
- [ ] Add link to backend in readme and vice versa.
