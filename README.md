# TODO APP

Your average todo app but with quite a few functionalities added to it.

### Tech used

- ReactJS for frontend
- Netlify for hosting frontend
- NodeJS for backend
- ExpressJS for routing
- mySQL as database
- PlanetScale for hosting mySQL database
- Fly.io for hosting backend

### TODO

[x] Adjust margins for top heading.
[x] Add a backend to store the todo data
[] Add a check if theme and todo exist in the localstorage because if they don't, Page won't load unless refreshed. Look more into this.
[] Idea: put a switch on the header to use local storage or remote database according to user preference.
[] Don't wait for database on initial load. Show a skeleton instead on the place of all the todo items.
[] Add a mui snackbar for when connection with database could not be established.
